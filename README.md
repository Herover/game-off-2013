## The Challenge

You have the entire month of November to create a **web-based** game *loosely* based on the theme "change".

What do we mean by **loosely** based on "change"? We literally mean, *loosely* based. Some examples might be a FPS where you throw the [loose change](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/loose%20change) in your pockets at the enemy or perhaps a puzzle game where you have to [change](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/change) form to overcome obstacles.

Your game. Your rules. You can participate either as an individual or as a team. You're encouraged to use open source libraries, frameworks, graphics, and sounds in your game.

## Sketchland
Sketchland takes place in a unknown future environment. Human civilization as we know it has been wiped out long ago, and only few historical documents describe what happened

You now find yourself in a post-apocalyptic world, searching for anything to hold on to. But what  seem like a nice place to stay the first day, might become wasteland the next day.

## Current state
List of main features
* Framework to move the view around the world using a mouse and clicking on stuff works pretty well.
* Inventory system is under development. 
* Wildlife is under development.
* Multiplayer is sort-of prepared, but not actual gameplay is higher priority.

## Open source software
Code from the following open source projects have been used:
* ["Simple JavaScript Inheritance"](https://github.com/mrdoob/stats.js/) by John Resig http://ejohn.org/ MIT
* ["stats.js"](http://ejohn.org/blog/simple-javascript-inheritance/) by mrdoob http://mrdoob.com/ MIT

## License
You can view the code, fork and publish your own version of this game, sell the product under a open source or non-open source license. (MIT/Beerware license).
Attribution is not needed, but a kind thing to do :)
